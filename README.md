# Forseti
A cross-platform delegation solution for IoT leasing.

* Platform: This is an IoT platform demo about integrating Forseti into existing platforms. It includes an OAuth example for cross-IoT platform cases.
* zkp: Forseti's encryption module. It includes the proof and verification model for permission authentication and transfer.
* blockchain: Forseti's consensus module. It includes smart contracts and the HTTP API to call the smart contract

In this project, we take Philips Bulb to describe how to integrate Forseti into its original platform design.

## Dependency
* Zero-knowledge Proof: ZKBoo and its dependency
https://github.com/Sobuno/ZKBoo

* Decentralized Ledger: Hyperledger Fabric (v2.2 LTS) and its dependency
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/

    You need to deploy the ledger by yourselves to run this project.
